# AccelCompMini

This repository holds all the code files necessary to recreat the results in my report.
Each run_ file has an associated .pyx and setup_ file by the same name.
Each file can be run directy from the terminal.

I have also attached a test.py file which automates the process, it runs tests for any number of iterations, however it is very computational expensive
and would be best run on a HPC rather than a laptop.
